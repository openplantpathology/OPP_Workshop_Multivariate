<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Principal Coordinates Analysis</h1>

</div>


<p>Principal coordinates analysis (also known as multidimensional
scaling or classical multidimensional scaling) was developed by John <a
href="http://hsta559s12.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/53338762/gower1966.pdf">Gower
(1966)</a>. The underlying mathematics of PCO and PCA share some
similarities (both depend on eigenvalue decomposition of matrices) but
their motivations are different and the details of the eigenvalue
analysis differ between the two methods. Whereas in PCA we typically
interested in learning about the major relationships among a set of
objects <em>and</em> how that relationship is determined by a set of
variables, in PCO the interest is primarily in the <em>similarity</em>
among the objects and the individual data variables are of secondary
importance. For this reason, the aim of PCO is often described as
reduction in dimensionality, while retaining the important information
about relationships among a set of objects. In the branch of
multivariate statistics associated with PCO, <em>similarity</em> , <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>and <em>distance</em> <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are defined as complements of one
another so <span class="math inline">\(S=1-D\)</span>.</p>
<p>The data structure analyzed in a PCO is a similarity (or distance)
matrix for a set of objects. The similarity (distance) matrix is
constructed from the data variables. The steps in the analysis are
therefore:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with two-way array of objects (rows) by variables
(columns</li>
<li>Construct a distance or similarity matrix for the objects on the
basis of the data using a suitable similarity index</li>
<li>Analyze the similarity (distance) matrix with PCO</li>
<li>Interpret the PCO, including <em>post hoc</em> comparison with the
original data or other variables of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>The base stats package in R gives us a basic set of tools to do a PCO
analysis without having to load specialized packages<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The
<code>dist()</code> function calculates a distance matrix from a data
frame of objects by variables using one of its inbuilt distance metrics
(more on this below). The <code>cmdscale()</code> function then takes
the distance matrix generated by <code>dist()</code> and performs a
classical PCO. Then, as with nearly all multivariate methods, the output
from the PCO needs to be examined in graph form to interpret the result
of the analysis.</p>
<div id="distance-matrices" class="section level2">
<h2>Distance matrices</h2>
<p>The point of PCO is to let us see how similar objects are to one
another on the basis of several variables simultaneously. As already
noted the idea of similarity here is a kind of statistical opposite of
distance, which raises the question of exactly what we mean by the
distance between objects in any specific case. Since our interpretation
of the PCO results will depend on the distance matrix we give the PCO
algorithm to analyze, the choice of how to calculate the distance
(similarity) matrix is an important step. Distance matrices are also the
central data object in cluster analysis (which we will deal with next)
so the issue of how to construct them deserves some attention.</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with the Euclidean concept of distance. If we have
measurements on two objects for a single continuous variable (say,
lesion area for rust pustules) we can express the distance between any
two objects simply as the absolute value of the difference between the
values. If we have measurements on two continuous variables, we have a
familiar two-dimensional space (one variable on the <em>x</em>-axis, the
other on the <em>y</em>-axis) and the distance between any two objects
<span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> in that space is given by the
well-known formula from Euclidean geometry:<span class="math display">\[
D_{i,j}=\sqrt{\left(x_{i}-x_{j}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{i}-y_{j}\right)^{2}}\]</span></p>
<p>This concept of distance can be extended to as many dimensions (or
variables) as we want by taking the <span
class="math inline">\(n^{th}\)</span> root if we have <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables. The Euclidean distance
metric is sensitive to extreme values and a variety of other metrics
which are conceptually similar, but differ in the detail of the
arithmetic. For example, the City Block metric (sometimes referred to as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan
distance metric</a>) produces similar results to the Euclidean metric
but is less sensitive to outliers. For variables that are discrete, but
ordinal (so they take on an increasing series of fixed, discrete values)
the City Block metric may be a better choice than the Euclidean. Both
the Euclidean and City Block metrics are special cases of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance">Minkowski
metric</a>, all three are available as options in the base stats
<em>dist</em>() function.</p>
<p>In the case of binary variables the concept of distance (or
similarity) is slightly different. Most of the commonly used metrics for
binary data are variations or elaborations on the idea of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming
distance</a> between to objects. Suppose we have two objects for which
we have measured a single binary variable. The possible pairs of values
are (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). The corresponding Hamming distances
are 0 ,1, 1, and 0; the Hamming distance measures the number of pairwise
differences between a pair of strings of equal length. So. if we have
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> binary variables measured on a
pair of objects at the variables differ at <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> positions the Hamming distance can be
expressed either a <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or as <span
class="math inline">\(D=\frac{x}{n}\)</span>. In the second format,
similarity can be calculated simply as <span class="math inline">\(S=
1-D\)</span>. The <em>binary</em> option in the <code>dist()</code>
function calculates a Hamming-like distance measure that ignores (0,0)
cases and calculates the count of differences only for variables where
at least one of the objects being compared has a “<em>present</em>”
score. In that respect it is conservative in that mutual absences of a
character are not interpreted as implying a similarity between two
objects, a feature that it shares with, for example, Jaccard’s
coefficient.</p>
<p>A distance measure calculated in this way won’t conform to Euclidean
geometry. This isn’t an issue in and of itself because the primary
concern is that any distance matrix is self-consistent, but since the
output from a PCO <strong><em>will</em></strong> ultimately be
interpreted through inspection of distances between points on graphs, it
is important to recognize that the initial distance matrix may not be
Euclidean and accordingly the low-dimensional projection generated by
the PCO may be a rather poor approximation of the actual distances among
the objects. We will see how to detect this departure of Euclidean
distance in the scree plot of the eigenvalues in the PCO solution. Note
that it is <strong>very</strong> common for this to happen.</p>
</div>
<div id="pco-example" class="section level2">
<h2>PCO example</h2>
<p>The data in this example come from the same survey of wheat crops in
Scotland as the disease data we looked at with PCA. In addition to
looking at which problems turned up in each wheat crop the survey team
also collected a standard set of information about the immediate
surroundings of the field and its local setting. For example, whether it
was bordered by post and wire fences, stone walls, grass banks,
hedgerows etc, and whether the surrounding land use included neighboring
wheat crops or other types of cropping and so on. The data set we use
here comprises 31 binary (presence/absence) variables recorded on 54
fields spread over three regions.</p>
<p>The following code block lets the data file be loaded and then
constructs a distance matrix, carries out the PCO and generates a scree
plot of the eigenvalues and some plots of the scores for the fields on
the PCO dimensions.</p>

<p>In common with PCA, the solution generated by PCO results in the
variance in the data being distributed over the new dimensions in
decreasing order from first to last. However the motivation for PCO (as
we discussed) is not to study the variance structure, but to project the
“distance” among the objects into a reduced dimensional space in such a
way that the solution preserves as much information about the true
distance relationships as possible. Note that in the <em>plot</em>()
calls we set the <em>asp</em> option = 1. This has the effect of making
sure that the physical scaling of the plot on the <em>x</em>- and
<em>y</em>-axes accurately represents Euclidean distance. Then, if the
PCO solution itself is approximately Euclidean the distances between
pairs of points on the plots will give a reasonable approximation of the
distance by which they differ in the overall distance matrix.</p>
<p>In the specific example, when we examine the plot of PCO dimensions 1
against 2 there is a suggestion of separation among the fields from the
different regions. If we swap the order of plotting the variables and
reverse their signs, we can see that the projection looks something like
the geographic map of the regions to which the fields belong.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fieldpco_plot &lt;- plot(-fieldPCO_dim2, -fieldPCO_dim1,
  asp = 1, cex = 1.5,
  xlab = &quot;PCO dimension 1&quot;, ylab = &quot;PCO dimension 2&quot;
)
text(-fieldPCO_dim2, -fieldPCO_dim1, cex = 1.5, margin_data$region)</code></pre>
<p><img src="2-MV_PCO_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>At this point, you are probably asking whether the apparent
separation of the regions in the PCO space is “significant”. PCO isn’t
really intended for hypothesis testing, but those who want to take this
further could try doing the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each the fields in each region, calculate the centroid position
in the PCO space for dimensions 1 and 2 (NOTE there are several choices
for how you could calculate the centroid).</li>
<li>For each region calculate a measure to variability in the scores
along each PCO dimension (your choice of measure of spread might be
linked to how you choose to calculate your estimate of central tendency
(i.e. centroid position)).</li>
<li>For each region add the centroid positions and some indication of
measure of spread to each region to assess the extent to which the
probable regions of the PCO space occupied by each region overlap.</li>
</ol>

<div id="variables-and-pco" class="section level2">
<h2>Variables and PCO</h2>
<p>A different question, but still one of interest in many studies is
how the original data are related to the PCO solution. Because the
original variables to do directly enter the analysis it takes a bit more
work than with a PCA to see if they are connected with the PCO solution.
The following procedure was suggested by the late Pete Digby (A UK
statistician who worked a great deal on multivariate techniques) and
others. If there is evidence of grouping along one the PCO dimensions,
we can do an approximate variance ratio test using each of the binary
variables in turn as a grouping factor and testing the variance ratio of
the scores on the PCO dimension for objects with and without the
variable. Those variables which have large F statistics (variance
ratios) are indicated as being associated with the grouping. It is not
axiomatically true that the PCO scores have a Normal distribution so the
test should be taken as approximate only.</p>
<p>Inspection of the PCO plots suggests that there are two clusters of
fields on the third PCO dimension. These do not appear to have a
regional basis so we will use the approximate F test to see which
variables might be associated with the clustering. To do this we’re
going to use a small <code>for{...}</code> loop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>select_data &lt;- margin_data[3:22]
Fvals &lt;- vector(length = ncol(select_data))
maxitem &lt;- length(Fvals)

for (i in 1:maxitem) {
  lm1 &lt;- lm(fieldPCO_dim3 ~ select_data[, i])
  av1 &lt;- anova(lm1)
  Fvals[i] &lt;- av1$F[1]
}
Fvalplot &lt;- barplot(log(Fvals, 10),
  names.arg = colnames(select_data), cex.names = 0.5,
  main = &quot;Approximate v.r. values on PCO dim 3&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="2-MV_PCO_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Plotting the barplot of F values on a log scale immediately lets you
differentiate those with v.r.&gt;1 (above the line) from those with v.r.
&lt;1 (below the line). We are interested only in those above the line
and in this case it is clear that one variable (grass as aa neighboring
crop) dominates the others. The cluster of fields with positive values
on PCO dimension 3 either have grass crops as neighbors or are close to
farm buildings with uncultivated ground, rough tracks or shelterbelts
nearby. These features may or may not be of any significance in the
ecology of the plant pathogens associated with the crops.</p>
